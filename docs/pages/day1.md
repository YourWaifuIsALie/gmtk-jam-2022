# GMTK Game Jam 2022: {{ page.title }}
{{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}

## Progress

A slow start. I had thoughts of some interesting ideas, but my dev ability is very low so none of them were realistic.

Going into this with no illusions, I'm definitely setting out to make a bare-bones puzzle "platformer". Ego has been left at the door.

Work completed today (in hours):
- 0.50 brainstorming
- 1.50 fumbling with input system, prototyping with 2d physics and sprites
- 2.50 fumbling with ground collision and turtle-like behavior
- 0.50 need an "up" for slight up/down control as turtle
- 1.25 rigid body rotation for turtle and falling status
- 0.50 basic object respawner
- 0.50 basic die key/lock
- 0.50 basic gate lerp + editing collision layers

Planning thoughts:
- Not too terrible. We're still pretty far off from something fun though. 
- Next stop is asset generation + polish. If nothing else we end this jam with a turtle and dice rolling down a hill.
  - The juice makes the game a lot of the time
- Then gameplay wise, the two elements we can probably for-sure include are:
  - Turtle switching
    - Some "advanced" mechanic is required for actual puzzles
    - Turtle switching isn't really related to theme. Can we make it somehow? RNG turtle spawn at minimum?
  - Rocket boosters
    - Because this might be the only juice that makes it "fun". Who doesn't like rocket turtles?
- Finally more polish and whatever else we can squeeze in
  - Beginning/Ending cutscene
  - More gameplay mechanics
    - Knife dicing
    - Biting/environment manipulation (picking up and throwing smaller dice)?
    - Turtle stacking
  - More levels
  - More theme-related things...

Total time:
0 + 5.75hr

## Theme thoughts

Turtle-flipping was on my mind, but it obviously doesn't have much to do with "Roll of the Dice."

I can definitely make more associations both in gameplay, narrative, and aesthetic.

Gameplay:
- Lots of dice rolling (downhill), including turtle rolling
- Scary knives (possibly dicing our poor hero)

Aesthetic:
- Turtle with a dice motif? Maybe a cute hat?
- Many tabletop-gamer related backgrounds

Narrative:
- Story is Mr. turtle remembers playing DnD with their owner and trying to get home
  - Post-apocalyptic sadness?
  - Just navigating an unnaturally large terrarium?
